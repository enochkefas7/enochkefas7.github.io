Extreme weather hits US
24th February 2023
Agency Report

Californians more used to flip flops and shorts were wrapping up warm Thursday as a rare winter blizzard — the first in more than 30 years — loomed over Los Angeles, even as the US east coast basked in summer-like temperatures.
Up to seven feet (2.1 meters) of snow were expected to hit hills around LA, the National Weather Service said, as it warned of “extremely dangerous mountain conditions.”

A blizzard warning, in effect from Friday morning, is the first one forecasters have raised in the area since 1989.

“We are still on track for our DANGEROUS winter storm. Expect blizzard conditions in the mountains with FEET of snowfall. A few inches of rain are expected in lower elevations. Be weather ready!” NWS Los Angeles tweeted.

While downtown Los Angeles was not expected to see any of the white stuff, the city is surrounded by mountains.

On a clear day the 10,000-foot Mount San Antonio and other peaks in the San Gabriel Mountains are visible, and their snow-capped tops should offer a pretty sight to city dwellers.

But for those trying to travel over mountain passes, it will be a different matter.

“Areas above the snowline will likely see a combination of strong winds and heavy snow,” the NWS in Hanford said.

“Travel will be difficult to near impossible during the passage of the cold front, especially over the mountain passes.”

In the Sierra, where storms in January left a voluminous snowpack, more was expected, along with plunging temperatures.

“Bundle up because it will be cold and windy!” forecasters said.

“Wind chills will be dangerous at times in exposed areas of the high Sierra, plunging as low as -30 degrees (Fahrenheit, -34 Celsius).” 
        <h2>Cyclone Gabrielle: New Zealand ‘open’ to international assistance</h2>

An overwhelmed New Zealand has said it is open to offers of international assistance as it battles with the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused widespread flooding and landslides in the country’s north and cut off some towns.

Five people have been confirmed dead after four days of strong winds and torrential rain. Authorities say 100 are missing and 10,500 more have been displaced.
Prime Minister Chris Hipkins on Thursday warned New Zealanders recovery would take time, with power not expected to be restored to some areas for weeks and the cleanup likely to take much longer.

“This is a traumatic event,” he said. “It’s a very big challenge to restore infrastructure as fast as we can but we have to acknowledge that we are in for a bumpy ride.”

After initially setting aside offers of help from the United States and other countries, Hipkins added: “We are accepting offers of international assistance.”

The New Zealand Defence Force has deployed two large ships and a C-130 Hercules transport plane to deliver thousands of litres of water along with personnel and several mobile water treatment plants to the most hard-hit regions.
It has also used helicopters to deliver supplies and rescue hundreds of people stranded on their rooftops.

On Thursday, Napier was cut off again after experts detected damage to the last bridge linking the town’s 65,000 people with the rest of the country.
<h3>Vancouver weather: Forecast sees heavy snow arriving in the evening</h3>
<img src="HTML/snow-1-.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
Most of B.C. was under weather warnings Saturday as a significant snowstorm approached.

Environment and Climate Change Canada's forecast for Vancouver called for light snow to begin in the early afternoon, with heavier precipitation arriving later in the day.

In the Lower Mainland, snowfall warnings called for 10 to 25 centimetres of total accumulation before the storm ends Sunday morning. At higher elevations, totals up to 30 centimetres are possible.

"For southern sections of Metro Vancouver, heavy snow is expected to transition to rain overnight with total snowfall amounts near 10 to 20 centimetres," reads Environment Canada's snowfall warning for the region.
in Vancouver, the record snowfall total for Feb. 25 since 1938 is just 3.6 centimetres, meaning Saturday's storm is likely to be a record-breaker. 

Municipal and provincial authorities spent much of the day Friday warning residents against non-essential travel and touting their preparations for the storm. 

The cold, dry conditions leading up to Saturday allowed city workers to get a head start on brining major routes and preparing salt and sand trucks.

Vancouver International Airport also announced its readiness for the storm, saying Friday that it had asked airlines to "ensure full towing capacity" in hopes of avoiding the hours-long waits on the tarmac experienced by some travellers during a major snowstorm the week before Christmas. 

Even the food delivery app DoorDash announced storm preparations, saying it had activated its "severe weather protocol" and would be halting deliveries in Metro Vancouver and several other communities on Saturday afternoon.

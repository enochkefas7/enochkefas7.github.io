    <p>Oil prices drop as rising inventories offset Russian output cuts</p>
    <img src="html/1671373487-1907.webp" style="width: 100%;">
    LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell below $82 a barrel on Friday as rising inventories in the United States and concerns over global economic activity offset the prospect of lower Russian exports.

    Brent crude futures were down 57 cents, or 0.7%, at $81.64 a barrel by 1423 GMT, having risen by more than $1 earlier in the session.
    
    West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) were down 69 cents, or 0.9%, at $74.70.
    
    On the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, benchmark Brent crude was about 15% lower than a year earlier. It hit a 14-year high of nearly $128 a barrel on Mar. 8, 2022.
    
    Both benchmarks rose about 2% in the previous session on Russia's plans to cut oil exports from its western ports by up to 25% in March, which exceeded its announced production cuts of 500,000 barrels per day.
    
    But the market appeared to be well supplied with U.S. inventories at their highest since May 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]
    Indications that Russian crude and refined products are accumulating on tankers floating at sea also indicated increasing supplies.

    JP Morgan said in a note on Friday that it thinks short-term prices are more likely to drift lower towards the $70s than rise "as global growth headwinds strengthen and excess 'dark' inventory exacerbated by a flooding of Russian oil is worked off".
    
    The bank also said it expects the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production to limit oil price declines.
    
    Oil prices were set for a second straight week of declines after the previous week's drop of about 4%, weighed also by concerns about rising interest rates that could strengthen the dollar and curb fuel demand.
    
    Minutes of the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting indicated that a majority of officials remained hawkish on inflation and tight labour market conditions, signalling further monetary tightening.
    
    The prospect of further interest rate hikes supported the dollar index, which was set for a fourth straight week of gains. The index is now up about 2.5% for the month. [FRX/]
    
    A firm dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.

<h2>Nepal preparing MoU with NHPC, state-run VUCL to develop hydropower project</h2>
<img src="html/1646099283-hydro.webp" style="width: 100%;">
Nepal is preparing an MoU in which India's hydroelectric major NHPC will collaborate with state-run VUCL to develop a 480 MW semi-reservoir hydropower project in the western part of the country at an estimated cost of Rs 92 billion, an official said on Friday.

The move comes days after Nepal and India inked an agreement to increase the power import and export capacity through the Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line from 600 MW to 800 MW.

"Our government has asked NHPC (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation), a government of India company, to collaborate with Nepal's Vidyut Utpadan Company Ltd (VUCL), to develop a hydropower project," Baburaj Adhikari, information officer at the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation told PTI.

According to the draft MoU, the Nepal government is planning for a 51:49 NHPC-VUCL joint venture.

If this MoU gets inked, the Phukot Karnali Hydropower Project, which is a semi-reservoir project with a capacity of 480 MW, will be constructed in Sani Triveni Rural Municipality-1 of Kalikot district in Nepal.

The feasibility study of the project has been completed, Adhikari said.

A 520-metre test tunnel was dug, and a plan to construct a 160-metre-high dam in Sisnegada of Sani Triveni Rural Municipality-3 and channel it through a 13.5 km tunnel to the power plant that would be constructed in Bhautegada of Sani Triveni Rural Municipality, he said.

"The estimated cost of this project is around Rs 92 billion, which is expected to be completed within five years after the start of construction," Adhikari explained.

The draft of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for investment with Nepali companies was being prepared, he said.

According to the draft MoU, Nepal will get 21.9 per cent free energy monthly from the project.

In it, NHPC will have to manage the market of the electricity generated from the project and the loan required to build the project on behalf of the promoter company.

If Nepal wants to consume the electricity of the project by itself, it will have the right to buy it, it said.

The project's surplus electricity will be exported to India, it added. Nepal became an energy surplus country ever since the 456MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project came into operation in August last year.

<h3>China economy to rebound in 2023 under precise monetary policy: PBoC</h3>
<img src="html/1673420524-8361 china.avif" style="width: 100%;">
China's economy is expected to generally rebound in 2023 and monetary policy will be precise and forceful, the central bank said in its quarterly policy implementation report released on Friday.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it will focus on supporting domestic demand expansion and stabilising economic growth and prices while avoiding "flood-like" stimulus, according to the report.

However, it said that the external environment remains "severe and complex", adding that the basics of domestic economic recovery are "not solid".

The report also said the property sector requires time to transition while the pressure of balancing local government fiscal revenue and expenditure persists.China will closely watch the trend and changes in inflation and keep the prices of energy and food stable, said the report.
The report has not changed substantially from the previous one, with markets anticipating a government reshuffle, especially of the economic team, and the announcement of economic targets and policies for 2023 during an annual parliamentary meeting kicking off on March 5.

The world's second-largest economy is stabilising and improving but still faces many challenges, Premier Li Keqiang said at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, after the country's economic growth slowed to one of the worst levels in half a decade due to stringent Covid-19 lockdowns and curbs in 2022.

The PBOC will keep liquidity reasonably ample and maintain effective credit growth, according to the report.The central bank also pledged to start improving social expectations and boosting confidence, mainly focusing on stabilising economic growth, employment and prices.

As the problematic property sector has showed a tentative recovery, the PBOC said it will satisfy reasonable financing demand in the sector but insist on not using real estate as a short-term means to stimulate the economy.

<h4>German economy shrank more than expected by 0.4% in fourth quarter of 2022</h4>
<img src="html/1642595684-0408 german.webp" style="width: 100%;">
The German economy shrank by 0.4 per cent in last year's fourth quarter, the national statistics office said Friday, a sharp downward revision from its initial report that gross domestic product declined by 0.2 per cent.

The quarter-on-quarter contraction in the October-December period was the first since the first quarter of 2021.

Consumer spending, which propped up growth in the first nine months of last year, dropped by 1 per cent in the final three months of 2022.

Investment in construction and machinery showed bigger drops in the final quarter, the Federal Statistical Office said.

The full-year 2022 growth figure for Germany Europe's biggest economy remained at the 1.8 per cent that the office reported at the end of January.
The economy has generally held up well, despite pressure from high inflation and fears last year of an energy crunch as Russia reduced and then cut off its gas supplies to Germany. That didn't materialise.

On Wednesday, a closely watched survey showed German business confidence strengthening for the fourth consecutive month.

That, however, was due entirely to an improvement in companies' outlook for the next six months. Their assessment of the current situation worsened slightly for the second consecutive month.

That, coupled with weak consumer confidence and other factors, underlines expectations that the German economy will contract again in the current first quarter, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.

"Not falling off the cliff is one thing; staging a strong rebound, however, is a different matter," he said in a research note.

He added that industrial orders have been weakening for the past years, consumer confidence, "is still close to historic lows, the loss of purchasing power will continue in 2023, and the full impact of monetary policy tightening still has to unfold.
